# Travel Portal

## Project Overview:
The Travel Portal is a web application that showcases various travel destinations through a visually appealing homepage. Each destination is represented by a card containing an image, title, and brief description. Users can click on a destination card to view more details, including an itinerary, a map, and a booking form.

## Features:
- **Homepage**: Displays multiple travel destination cards with images, titles, and short descriptions.
- **Destination Details Page**: Includes a larger image, detailed description, itinerary, map integration, and a booking form.
- **JSON Data Handling**: Travel destination data is stored and retrieved from a JSON source.
- **Booking Form**: Allows users to select a destination, enter personal details, and submit the form.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled correctly before submission.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

## Files Used:
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic content handling and interactivity.
- **JSON**: Data storage and retrieval.
- **Leaflet/Google Maps API**: Map integration for location display.

## How to Run:
- Open the index.html file with a live server.
- Verify cards render with correct JSON data
- Click a card and verify it takes you to a detail view
- Test booking form and see that it gives an alert that says booked and logs data for the booking
- Test responsiveness like a mobile and desktop view
